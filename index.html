                &ldquo; As a mentor, I have had the pleasure of working with Univer Omoro for the past few months.
                During that time, I have been continually impressed by Univer's dedication to learning and improving
                in their tech career. She has a natural curiosity and enthusiasm that makes our sessions together both
                productive and enjoyable. It has been a pleasure to watch Univer grow and develop over the past few months,
                and I have no doubt that she has a bright future ahead in the tech industry. If you are looking for a talented
                and motivated Software Developer, I highly recommend Univer Omoro. &rdquo;

                &ldquo;It was great working with Univer very keen to detail a good Front end developer with skills in design and website dynamism.
                She is very keen to details with a great catch for team work.She is the type of person you would want around when solving problems.
                The consistency keeps her up to beat with technology and it seems that she knows more than  what people would think she only knows.  &rdquo;

                &ldquo; Univer Omoro is one outstanding individual with unmatched leadership skills.She knows when and how to push for results.
                I came to know her through a learning program at PLP(power learn project).We were paired for a group project which she assumed the
                leadership role quickly.Throughout our experience at PLP,Univer was always ahead to make sure that we do what is really needed to succeed
                with our group projects,handling adults is quite a task really,but not to Univer.I can boldly say that it is through her leadership skill
                matched with ambition and unwavering quest for more that our grouped managed to be among the top 20 projects out of a possible 300 hundred other projects.
                That’s a fête that required alot of pressuring,group calls,zoom meetings,phone calls and text messages,Univer did it!She managed to keep our team in check
                and in togetherness as we worked for the same goals and finally graduated as the first cohorts of PLP 2022.&rdquo;
